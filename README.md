# Hangman-Game-
The Hangman Game in Python is an engaging and interactive console-based application that brings the classic word-guessing game to life. Developed using Python, this game offers a user-friendly experience with clear instructions and visually appealing hangman graphics.

Key Features:

Word Categories: Players can choose from three different word categories â€“ animals, countries, and movies. Each category comes with a unique set of words to make the game more diverse and entertaining.

Dynamic Hangman Graphics: The game features dynamic hangman graphics that visually represent the player's progress. With each incorrect guess, a new part of the hangman is drawn, adding an element of suspense and challenge.

Random Word Selection: The game randomly selects a word from the chosen category, ensuring a varied and unpredictable gaming experience. This feature keeps players on their toes and encourages replayability.

User Input Validation: The program validates user inputs, ensuring that only valid letters are accepted as guesses. The game prompts users to enter a single letter and provides appropriate feedback for invalid inputs.

Game Progress Display: Throughout the game, players can see the progress of their guesses with a display that shows the correctly guessed letters and underscores for the yet-to-be-discovered ones.

Winning and Losing Scenarios: The game continues until the player either correctly guesses the word or exhausts the allowed attempts. In case of success, a congratulatory message is displayed along with the revealed word. If unsuccessful, the correct word is revealed, and players are encouraged to try again.
